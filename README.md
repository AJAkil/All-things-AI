# Book_recommendation

A simple book recommendation system using Nearest Neighbors Algorithm. The dataset was colledted from [here](https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/project-data/books/book-crossings.zip).
This is the **book crossings** dataset with mulltiple CSV files. Two of the csv files were used for the project. The details of the dataset can be found [here](http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~cziegler/BX/).
The required details of the project are explained in the notebook with details.

# PREDICTING CAR PRICE BASED ON SOME RELEVANT FEATURE

In This Guided Project by Dataquest.io, a car data set(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/automobile) was given. You can read more about the dataset from the link provided.

The task was to create a prediction model based on **knn** algorithm. A python jupyter notebook and the dataset was provided with the repository for ease of use. Dependencies that required to be installed in order to run in the local computer:

- Python(Anything with version 3.x)
- Numpy library
- Pandas library
- Matplotlib library
- Scikit-learn library

With the correct installments, just running the cells of the notebook would suffice. Individual description of the work-flow is provided in the notebook itself. Consider that this is under development, I would refactor this more and also add new regression algorithm in the future to test on the dataset.
